### ***How To Use Modular-Construction-of-Minimal-Models:***
* You will need txt file within set of clauses, each variable is a number("0" cant be a variable) , separate each rule with "0" number.In the beginning you will need to write(in the txt file) how many rules(clauses) there is.  

* Run the application .

* you have to change the txt file "CnfFile.txt" with the following rules.

* First line is to write the number of rules.

* after every rules are in separate line when "0" is mark that end of line

* body are negative integers head are positive integers

* The result is that you will see if there is minimal module it will find it, if not it will write that can find.

### ***How To Use Minimal balanced node separator:***

* If you would like to run **ONLY** to graph separator algorithm you have to do the following:
  
* Run the readGraphFromFileNewAlgorithm.java class which is in Test package.

* you can change the txt file "GraphFile.txt" with the following rules.

* in every line the first number is an vertex that edge is coming out to every one of the next number in the same line </br> for example if one line is written 1 2 77 9 it says that there is an edges from : 1->2, 1->77, 1->9.</br> **don't forget it is a directed graph**
